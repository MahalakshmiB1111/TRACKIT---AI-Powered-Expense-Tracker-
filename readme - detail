#This Tkinter-based Expense Tracker helps users manage spending by adding, viewing, and deleting expenses. It supports budget setting, shows remaining or overspent amounts, visualizes expenses with pie charts, and predicts future costs using linear regression. A built-in chatbot assists with usage.


#This program is a Tkinter-based Expense Tracker that helps users manage, analyze, and predict their spending. It provides an interactive graphical interface where users can add, view, delete, and analyze their expenses while also setting a budget to monitor financial goals.

#At its core, the application stores all expenses in a file (`expenses.txt`) and the budget in (`budget.txt`). Users can add an expense by entering the date, category, and amount. Input validation ensures only numerical values are accepted for amounts. Expenses are displayed in a Treeview widget, allowing clear tabular visualization. A delete feature lets users remove any selected record. The application also continuously updates the total expense displayed on screen.

#An important feature is the budget management system. Users can set a budget, which is saved and reloaded each time the application starts. The tracker compares total expenses against the budget and updates the status with remaining or overspent amounts. This makes it useful for maintaining financial discipline.The app goes further by offering data analysis and prediction. 

#Using matplotlib, it provides a pie chart of expenses categorized by type, giving insight into spending habits. Additionally, with the help of scikit-learnâ€™s Linear Regression, it predicts expenses for the next seven days based on historical data. This predictive analysis is visualized using graphs, with annotations for better clarity.

#A calendar widget allows easy date selection, making data entry user-friendly. Moreover, the built-in chatbot assistant guides users by answering common queries such as how to add, delete, or visualize expenses. It also provides quick help for understanding features like budgeting and prediction.

#Overall, this program combines **expense management, budgeting, visualization, prediction, and chatbot assistance** into a single tool. It is practical for anyone who wants to track spending effectively while gaining insights into their financial patterns.
